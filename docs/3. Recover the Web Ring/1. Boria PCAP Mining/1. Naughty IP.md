Hey there! I'm Alabaster Snowball

And I have to say, I'm a bit distressed.

I was working with the dwarves and their Boria mines, and I found some disturbing activity!

Looking through these artifacts, I think something naughty's going on.

Can you please take a look and answer a few questions for me?

First, we need to know where the attacker is coming from.

If you haven't looked at Wireshark's Statistics menu, this might be a good time!
