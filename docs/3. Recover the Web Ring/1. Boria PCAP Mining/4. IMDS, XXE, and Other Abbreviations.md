The last step in this attack was to use XXE to get secret keys from the IMDS service. What URL did the attacker force the server to fetch?

Difficulty: 2/5

Great! Just one more challenge! It looks like they made the server pull credentials from IMDS. What URL was forced?

AWS uses a specific IP address for IMDS lookups. Searching for that in the PCAP should get you there quickly.

What URL did the attacker force the server to fetch?
AWS uses a specific IP address to access IMDS, and that IP only appears twice in this PCAP.

169.254.169.254 is the specific IP address for IMDS lookups used by AWS. Let's search for this in the PCAP:

```

There are multiple XXE requests but the one that returns what the attacker was looking for is this one:
```
<!ENTITY id SYSTEM "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/identity-credentials/ec2/security-credentials/ec2-instance">
```

## Rejoice
Fantastic! It seems simpler now that I've seen it once. Thanks for showing me!

Hey, so maybe I can help you out a bit with the door to the mines.

First, it'd be great to bring an Elvish keyboard, but if you can't find one, I'm sure other input will do.

Instead, take a minute to read the HTML/JavaScript source and consider how the locks are processed.

Next, take a look at the Content-Security-Policy header. That drives how certain content is handled.

Lastly, remember that input sanitization might happen on either the client or server ends!
