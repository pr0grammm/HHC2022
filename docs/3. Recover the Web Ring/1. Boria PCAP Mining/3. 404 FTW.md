The next attack is forced browsing where the naughty one is guessing URLs. What's the first successful URL path in this attack?

Difficulty: 1/5

Alice? I totally expected Eve! Well how about forced browsing? What's the first URL path they found that way?

The misses will have HTTP status code 404 and, in this case, the successful guesses return 200.

## Terminal
First apply the display filter as shown in the below image and find the first packet with a 404 response code. Click on the packet and now enter `http.response.code == 0` in the find packet toolbar. This will highlight the 200 successful response amidst the several 404 misses.

`/proc` is the URL path they found by guessing URLs.

Great! Just one more challenge! It looks like they made the server pull credentials from IMDS. What URL was forced?

AWS uses a specific IP address for IMDS lookups. Searching for that in the PCAP should get you there quickly.
