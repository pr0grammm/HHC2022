### Chat with Santa
>Welcome to the North Pole, intrepid traveler!
>
>Wow, we had quite a storm last night!
>
>My castle door is sealed shut behind a giant snowbank.
>
>The Elves have decided to burrow under the snow to get everything ready for our holiday deliveries.
>
>But there's another wrinkle: my Five Golden Rings have gone missing.
>
>Without the magic of the Rings, we simply can't launch the holiday season.
>
>My reindeer won't fly; I won't be able to zip up and down chimneys.
>
>What's worse, without the magic Rings, I can't fit the millions of cookies in my belly!
>
>I challenge you to go on a quest to find and retrieve each of the five Rings.
>
>I'll put some initial goals in your badge for you.
>
>The holidays, and the whole world, are counting on you.
