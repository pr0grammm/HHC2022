## Chat with Dusty Giftwrap
Hi! I'm Dusty Giftwrap!

We think the Snowrog was attracted to the pungent smell from the baking lembanh.

I'm trying to discover which ingredient could be causing such a stench.

I think the answer may be in these suspicious logs.

I'm focusing on Windows Powershell logs. Do you have much experience there?

You can work on this offline or try it in this terminal.

Golly, I'd appreciate it if you could take a look.

## Terminal
```
Grinchum successfully downloaded his keylogger and has gathered the admin credential
We think he used PowerShell to find the Lembanh recipe and steal our secret ingredient.    
Luckily, we enabled PowerShell auditing and have exported the Windows PowerShell logs to a 
flat text file.                                                                            
Please help me analyze this file and answer my questions.                                  
Ready to begin? yes                                                                        
1. What month/day/year did the attack take place? For example, 09/05/2021.                 
: hint                                                                                     
Hint 1: This is data that appears a lot in the log

Hint 2: sort and unique are great commands.
1. What month/day/year did the attack take place? For example, 09/05/2021.
: 12/24/2022
12/24/2022 is correct!

2. An attacker got a secret from a file. What was the original file's name?                
: hint                                                                                     
Hint 1: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/add-content?view=powershell-7.3

2. An attacker got a secret from a file. What was the original file's name?                
: Recipe                                                                             
Recipe is correct!

Hint 1: The desired line in the file will start with a $ since the question specifies[0/45]erShell variable (ex- $var).
3. The contents of the previous file were retrieved, changed, and stored to a variable by the attacker. This was done multiple times. Submit the last full PowerShell line that performed only these actions.
Hint 2: To narrow your search look at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-content?view=powershell-7.3

: $foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_ -replace 'honey', 'fish oil'}                         
$foo = Get-Content .\Recipe| % {$_ -replace 'honey', 'fish oil'} is correct!

4. After storing the altered file contents into the variable, the attacker used the variabl
e to run a separate command that wrote the modified data to a file. This was done multiple 
times. Submit the last full PowerShell line that performed only this action.               
: $foo | Add-Content -Path 'Recipe'                                                        
$foo | Add-Content -Path 'Recipe' is correct!                                              

5. The attacker ran the previous command against a file multiple times. What is the name of
 this file?                                                                                
: Recipe.txt                                                                               
Recipe.txt is correct!                                                                     
6. Were any files deleted? (Yes/No)                                                        
: Yes                                                                                    
Yes is correct!

7. Was the original file (from question 2) deleted? (Yes/No)                               
: no                                                                                       
No is correct!                                             

8. What is the Event ID of the log that shows the actual command line used to delete the f$
le?                                                                                        
: 4104                                                                                     
4104 is correct!                                             

9. Is the secret ingredient compromised (Yes/No)?                                          
: yes                                                                                      
Yes is correct!                                                                            
10. What is the secret ingredient?                                                         
: honey
```

## Rejoice
Say, you did it! Thanks a million!

Now we can mix in the proper ingredients and stop attracting the Snowrog!

I'm all set now! Can you help Fitzy over there wield the exalted Suricata?

It can be a bit mystifying at first, but this Suricata Tome should help you fathom it.

I sure hope you can make it work!
