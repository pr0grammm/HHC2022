## Chat with Fitzy Shortstack
Hm?.. Hello...

Sorry, I don't mean to be uncharaceristically short with you.

There's just this abominable Snowrog here, and I'm trying to comprehend Suricata to stop it from getting into the kitchen.

I believe that if I can phrase these Suricata incantations correctly, they'll create a spell that will generate warnings.

And hopefully those warnings will scare off the Snowrog!

Only... I'm quite baffled. Maybe you can give it a go?

## Terminal

Use your investigative analysis skills and the suspicious.pcap file to help develop Suricata rules for the elves!

There's a short list of rules started in suricata.rules in your home directory.

First off, the STINC (Santa's Team of Intelligent Naughty Catchers) has a lead for us.
They have some Dridex indicators of compromise to check out.
First, please create a Suricata rule to catch DNS lookups for adv.epostoday.uk.
Whenever there's a match, the alert message (msg) should read Known bad DNS lookup, possible Dridex infection.
Add your rule to suricata.rules

Once you think you have it right, run ./rule_checker to see how you've done!
As you get rules correct, rule_checker will ask for more to be added.

If you want to start fresh, you can exit the terminal and start again or cp suricata.rules.backup suricata.rules

Good luck, and thanks for helping save the North Pole!

`alert dns any any -> any any (dns.query;msg:"Known bad DNS lookup, possible Dridex infection.";content:"adv.epostoday.uk"; sid:1;)`

First rule looks good!

STINC thanks you for your work with that DNS record! In this PCAP, it points to 192.185.57.242.
Develop a Suricata rule that alerts whenever the infected IP address 192.185.57.242 communicates with internal systems over HTTP.
When there's a match, the message (msg) should read Investigate suspicious connections, possible Dridex infection.

`alert http 192.185.57.242 any -> $HOME_NET any (msg: "Investigate suspicious connections, possible Dridex infection";)`

For the second indicator, we flagged 454 packet(s), but we expected 681. Please try again!

`alert http 192.185.57.242 any <> $HOME_NET any (msg: "Investigate suspicious connections, possible Dridex infection"; sid:2;)`

> note the <>, which is used so that the rule matches both ways.

First rule looks good!

Second rule looks good!

We heard that some naughty actors are using TLS certificates with a specific CN.
Develop a Suricata rule to match and alert on an SSL certificate for heardbellith.Icanwepeh.nagoya.
When your rule matches, the message (msg) should read Investigate bad certificates, possible Dridex infection.

> The Common Name (AKA CN) represents the server name protected by the SSL certificate.

`alert tls any any -> any any (tls.cert_subject; content:"CN=heardbellith.Icanwepeh.nagoya"; msg:"Investigate bad certificates, possible Dridex infection"; sid:3;)`


Third rule looks good!

OK, one more to rule them all and in the darkness find them.
Let's watch for one line from the JavaScript: let byteCharacters = atob
Oh, and that string might be GZip compressed - I hope that's OK!
Just in case they try this again, please alert on that HTTP data with message Suspicious JavaScript function, possible Dridex infection.

From the docs: 
> http.response_body will match on gzip decoded data just like file_data does.

`alert http any any -> any any (http.response.body; content: "let byteCharacters = atob"; msg:"Suspicious JavaScript function, possible Dridex infection"; sid:4;)`
## Rejoice

Woo hoo - you wielded Suricata magnificently! Thank you!

Now to shout the final warning of power to the Snowrog...

YOU...SHALL NOT...PASS!!!

## Find the Next Objective

We found the Tolkien Ring! Onto the search for the Elfen Ring!

## Random chat wit Grinchum

😒Who took you, Precious? How did they take you? Mustn't happen again.

🙂 Oh, hello, humanses. Maybe we can offer help?

😏 Yes... Grinchum will help the humanses.

We are trying to distract them from finding the rest of you, Preciouses, with talk of hints and coinses.

🙂 Have you found the coffers yet? The ones at the end of hidden paths?

😏 There's hintses in them, and coinses, they're veeerrryy special.

🙂 Just look hard, for little, bitty, speckles or other oddities.

Don't worry, they will not look for you, Preciouses. Shhh...

🙂 Go on, humanses. Start searching!
