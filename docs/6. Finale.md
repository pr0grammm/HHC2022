## The Story
Five Rings for the Christmas king immersed in cold

Each Ring now missing from its zone

The first with bread kindly given, not sold

Another to find 'ere pipelines get owned

One beneath a fountain where water flowed

Into clouds Grinchum had the fourth thrown

The fifth on blockchains where shadows be bold

One hunt to seek them all, five quests to find them

One player to bring them all, and Santa Claus to bind them

## Chat with Santa

Congratulations! You have foiled Grinchum's foul plan and recovered the Golden Rings!

And by the magic of the rings, Grinchum has been restored back to his true, merry self: Smilegol!

You see, all Flobbits are drawn to the Rings, but somehow, Smilegol was able to snatch them from my castle.

To anyone but me, their allure becomes irresistable the more Rings someone possesses.

That allure eventually tarnishes the holder's Holiday Spirit, which is about giving, not possesing.

That's exactly what happened to Smilegol; that selfishness morphed him into Grinchum.

But thanks to you, Grinchum is no more, and the holiday season is saved!

Ho ho ho, happy holidays!

## Chat with Smilegol

I must give you my most thankful of thanks, and most sorry of sorries.

I'm not sure what happened, but I just couldn't resist the Rings' call.

But once you returned the Rings to Santa, I was no longer so spellbound.

I could think clearly again, so I shouted off that awful persona.

And that grouchy Grinchum was gone for good. Now, I can be me again, just in time for gift giving.

This is a lesson I won't soon forget, and I certainly won't forget you.

I wish you smooth sailing on wherever your next voyage takes you!
